# **The Future of Medical Genetics and the Importance of Digital Health**

When one talks about genetic medicine; this sounds like it is something out of science fiction. But as today, we can do all these bizarre things. Maybe not everything out of the movies, but a fraction of it. Now the idea of medical genetics is that we apply [the genetic principles](https://www.ashg.org/discover-genetics/medical-genetics/#:~:text=Medical%20genetics%20is%20any%20application)  to medical practice, which includes studies of inheritance, mapping disease genes, diagnosis and treatment, and genetic counselling. Apart from that, how is this tied to digital health, and what the future holds in the world of medicine for us? 

## **How does this work?**

This is done by genetic engineering through the usage of a process of recombinant DNA technology called CRISPR by altering the genetic makeup of an organism. [Recombinant DNA technology](https://youthmedicaljournal.org/2021/03/21/the-future-of-genetic-engineering/) utilises enzymes in a lab to manipulate the DNA of interest; a gene of interest from an organism is integrated into another organism such as bacteria or yeasts as a host. This then creates a recombinant DNA from 2 species, the combining process is called DNA splicing. The resulting hosting organism will replicate the DNA with its own, producing the desired protein. An example of this is the production of insulin to treat diabetes.

With a similar concept, gene therapies are performed to treat genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, thalassemia, haemophilia, and sickle cell anaemia using [genome editing](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/genetic-therapies). It is a newer approach that allows precise correction or other targeted changes to DNA in cells to restore a cell’s function. This process allows direct modification of the cells in the body, or the cells will be collected and treated outside of the body and then returned to the body. An example of this could be the treatment of cancer where the immune cells in the body are retrieved then it is modified to attack the cancer cells, and then reintroduce the modified immune cells into the body.

## Slight history of genetic engineering and the potential future

This all might sound scary. Yes, it is, but it has been in practice for decades, since the early 1960s. Here is a quick summary of the history of GT:
<img src="Figure 2.png">
**Figure 2 History of gene therapy, [Source:  TAMURA, R., & TODA, M. (2020). Historic Overview of Genetic Engineering Technologies for Human Gene Therapy. _Neurologia Medico-Chirurgica, 60_(10), 483–491. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7555159/)**

<img src="Figure 3.png"> **Figure 3 History of gene therapy 2, [Source:TAMURA, R., & TODA, M. (2020). Historic Overview of Genetic Engineering Technologies for Human Gene Therapy. _Neurologia Medico-Chirurgica, 60_(10), 483–491. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7555159/)**

Why does history matter? As we have seen, genetic-related treatments are carefully monitored and legalised. Because there are potential dangers within the works of genetic manipulation. We could create a so-called “super-pathogen” or “disabled organism” from the result of it, and eventually doom us all by accidentally creating a bioweapon from sci-fi movies. Because of this, many ethical issues arise.

In 2019, a scientist in China created genetically altered twins, by altering the genes of the embryos. [Vera Lucia Raposo](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6724388/#r16) claims that,
> “Their birth was the result of an ‘experiment' (presently it can only be called that) conducted by He Jiankui with couples in which the males were HIV carriers. Using CRISPR technology to immunise the babies against the HIV virus, He Jiankui managed to disable the CCR5 gene that enables the HIV infection (although he still did not present complete evidence of this achievement). Furthermore, in spite of the alleged reason for the genetic intervention related with the prevention of HIV, the scientific community also knows that the CCR5 gene is related with major brain functions. He Jiankui might have done some kind of human enhancement by created two especially intelligent human beings, with better memory and higher IQ.” 

Which begs many questions, such as: is it ethical at all, what will be the consequences of the twins if an error that leads to disability is made, and what if he just created a lineage of superhumans unintentionally?  Because the genetic alteration he has done is not quite what we are practising today, [somatic gene editing, but instead germline gene editing](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/01/perspectives-on-gene-editing/). This means it has an impact not only on the person whom he had edited, but possibly they may pass on the edited genes to their descendants.

## How is this significant to the future of medical genetics? Or perhaps, how will this affect the future of medical genetics?

First, there is no real answer for this one yet. One could only hope that a good turn will come, depending on the outcome of He Jiankui’s “experimental twins”. That is to say that if the outcome is good for them, the scientific community will start changing their views on germline gene editing despite the risks. Pretty much like IVF, which people found unacceptable at first, are now accepting IVF because of its success and the increasing rate of infertility in the modern society.

Moreover, if the circumstances have led to favour the practice of germline gene editing, I believe that this will become a huge field of medicine and research. Because of the potential to prevent a child with genetic disorders, or diseases before birth. This would save both the government and the parents a lot of money and resources.

## But how does Information Technology come into play?

Well, as of now, there are a lot of genome databases that are available. And it will only continue to increase as the old genomic data will not be erased and new data will always be added. It also means that more IT specialists will increase over the years. Additionally, because precision is required within this field of work due to the nature of genetics, high computational analytics will be required. And so, data scientists, especially in the fields of bioinformatics, genomics and quantitative biology would have larger demand than it is now. Hence, people who pursue these areas of subjects would be likely to gain better recognition in the future.

As such, data science would make the analysis of genes and genome profiling much faster than humans. In addition, the advancement of AIs could be beneficial, because AIs today are so powerful that they could learn the patterns of genes and would be able to predict genes of the phenotypes that are complicated to identify, such as height.

## The Obvious Challenges and How they Could be Overwhelmed

Apart from that, we have seen many countries try to push their health care into a more digital platform because of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had caused. Although digitalisation in healthcare is not quite agreed upon because of the lack of physical contact, the accessibility of healthcare to wider populations outweighs the lack of comfort that physical contact could provide. This has proven to be true during the COVID-19 pandemic and has pushed the advancement of digital health. As such, it could be also the same in genetic medicine, when necessary.

The bigger challenges are, however, not the challenges that are against the breakout of the norm from the traditional medium. But within the digitalisation itself. As such, data security would be the main challenge in this field, especially the medical records, which hold sensitive information about the patients that could potentially have their privacy breached. To prevent this, we must ensure that the data of the patients are well-encrypted and secured. This in turn leads to the need to hire more cybersecurity specialists, and it could be costly for the paying party.

This also means that the utilisation of telemedicine will be required. For this to be successful, the government must also take part in the process to ensure that the internet connection is at optimal bandwidths for the process to be successful. Without the proper connections, the whole purpose of fast healthcare delivery could be defeated. This issue had been stated by a researcher of digital medicine in Germany, [Johanna Tecklenburg](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/medgen-2021-2057/html#j_medgen-2021-2057_ref_006_w2aab3b7c37b1b6b1ab2b1b6Aa), who had discussed the problems and the solutions to integrate digitalisation into the German healthcare system.


## Conclusion

If germline editing does get approved, ethical issues will surely rise; business institutions will try to take advantage of the new advancement once it comes to a legal term, selling, what I would predict, are “the perfect children” with high intelligence, physical capabilities, and appearances. This could also lead to governments creating an army of “perfect humans”. Nevertheless, this is a very long way to go, and it won’t happen until a few decades later. Even then, this practice would just be still in the experimentation phase.

Finally, the strong effort and support of the government, and the cooperation of healthcare professionals, data scientists, genomic biologists and researchers will be required if the operation is to succeed. 

The future looks bright in the field of medicine, and I hope that all of these could come to fruition for the better of the health of our humankind, and not for the worse to come.
